# SimpleFileSystem
Final project for Operating Systems class at McGill University

There were a few components to this file system:
  First)
        The file system was supported by a emulation of disk blocks created by another file such that the program only had to interact with the memory instead of actually write and read date from the disk, as an actual file system would. Thus 'Simple', however this project did require the implementation of topics such as i-nodes, file descriptor tables, and Root blocks in order to effectivly store and retrieve data from the emulated disk in the same way that a operational file system would.
